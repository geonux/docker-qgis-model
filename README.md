# QGIS Docker container for QGIS models

This project contains two Docker containers to run QGIS models based on a model file and a minimal Python script from the command line. The Python script contains the actual model call, using all the required input data files (which a generic script cannot guess). There are two ways to use the image. First, run it locally and mount the required script and data. Second, create a new Dockerfile to build an image that embeds the data.

The first variant is based on the QGIS Desktop container by [Kartoza](https://github.com/kartoza/docker-qgis-desktop), which is based on Debian. Thanks, Kartoza!
The second one is based on Ubuntu and UbuntuGIS repository. It was originally based on [Todd Stavish](https://github.com/toddstavish/Dockerfiles/tree/master/QGIS)'s work. Thanks, Todd!

All commands in this document are executed from within the repository's root directory.


## Example

A working example for calculating an NDVI based on a GeoTIFF is in the directory `/example`. To run it, first build the Ubuntu container and then run it with the following commands (executed from the root of this project):

```
docker build -t qgis-model-ubuntu:trusty -f ubuntu/trusty/Dockerfile ubuntu/.
docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd)/example/:/data qgis-model-ubuntu:trusty
```

Take a look at the console - it contains several useful log statements. A new directory was created in `/example`. It contains the resulting GeoTIFF (`result.tif`) and a JPG preview file (`result.jpg`).


## Example with embedded data

If you want to embed the data into the container, you can create your own dockerfile and directly `COPY` your data directory to the location `/data` inside the container. See `/example/Dockerfile` for a template.


## Preparations

Prepare a directory with the following contents. In the remainder of these instructions, we will assume it is called `data`.

* `/models/*.model` - your QGIS workflow model (one only, or configure name via environment variable `QGIS_MODELFILE`)
  * when the container is executed, this file is copied into the model directory of the root user under the name `model.docker` so that it must be referenced in the python file as `"modeler:docker"`
* `model.py` - a minimal Python file with the run command referencing the required data files, see template below. Depending on your model, the actual call to `processing.runalg(...)` will look very different. For example, it might container several inputs and/or outputs.
* all data files
* any additional user scripts in `scrips/*.py`

**Python file template:**

```
#!/usr/bin/python

# Run preparation file
import sys
sys.path.append("/qgis/util")
import prepare

# Import and initialize Processing framework
from processing.core.Processing import Processing
Processing.initialize()
import processing

# Run model
input="/data/input.file"
output="/data/output.file"

print "Start processing..."
processing.runalg("modeler:docker",input,output)
print "Processing complete"
``` 


## Run the model

Build the container (see below) and start it with the following command, mounting your `data` directory to `/data` and replacing `<platform>` with either `debian` or `ubuntu`. If you want to publish your model in a container, see next section.

```
docker run --rm -it	-v /<path to data dir>:/data qgis-model-<platform>
```

<!--
docker run -it --rm -v /home/daniel/ownCloud/Reproducible-OBIA/QGIS/data/:/data -e QGIS_MODELFILE=/data/*_zonal.model qgis-model-debian /bin/bash
docker run -it --rm -v /home/daniel/ownCloud/Reproducible-OBIA/QGIS/data/:/data --entrypoint /bin/bash qgis-model-ubuntu
docker run -it --rm -v /home/daniel/ownCloud/Reproducible-OBIA/QGIS/data/:/data qgis-model-ubuntu
docker run -it --rm -v /home/daniel/ownCloud/Reproducible-OBIA/QGIS/data/:/data -e QGIS_MODELFILE=/data/*_zonal.model qgis-model-ubuntu
-->

### Configuration

If you want to run the model manually (i.e. to debug etc.) append `/bin/bash` to the command to override the default command, then execute `./qgis/model.sh` manually.

The used options are as follows:
* `--rm` will remove the container as soon as it ends
* The startup script will copy all files named `*.model` from the mounted directory

Potentially useful additional options are as these:
* `--name="qgis"` to name the running container for easier identification
* To *execute a specific model*, you can overwrite the environment variable `QGIS_MODELFILE` which has the default value `/data/*.model`. This is useful if you have a working directory with more than one model file. Specify the environment variable when you run the container: `docker run --rm -it -v /<path to data dir>:/data -e QGIS_MODELFILE=/data/mymodel.model qgis-model-<platform>`
* If you want to run the model manually (i.e. to debug etc.) add the parameter `--entrypoint=/bin/bash` to the command (before the image name) to override the default entrypoint and get a bash shell, then execute `./qgis/model.sh` manually.

### Access log while running

After the model has started you can access the current state of the containers log file with the command `docker exec`:

```
docker ps
# note the name of the container running the command /qgis/model.sh
docker exec <container name> cat /qgis/qgis.log
```

Alternatively to `cat`, you can `less` or other tools.


## Create a self-contained image

The previous run command mounts a directory of the host computer to the container, which is suitable for model development. If you want to publish a self-contained Docker image, you can create a minimal Dockerfile to copy your data into the container, see `/example/Dockerfile`. Then build and execute your own container and image:

```
docker build -t qgis-my-model example/.
docker run qgis-my-model
```


## Build the container

### Debian

* See directory `/debian` for the Dockerfile
* http://kartoza.com/qgis-desktop-in-docker/
* https://github.com/kartoza/docker-qgis-desktop/tree/develop/2.14
  * mounts X11 (and dis/enables xhost, for minimum security)

Execute the following command to build the container and name it.

```
docker build -t qgis-model-debian debian/.
```

You can also run an interactive version of this container (with QGIS user interface) by adding the following parameters to the `docker run` call, for details see [the base images starth.sh script](https://github.com/kartoza/docker-qgis-desktop/blob/develop/2.14/start.sh).

```
xhost +local:docker
docker run -it --rm -v /<path to user home>:/home/<user name> -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY qgis-model-debian /start.sh
xhost -local:docker
```
<!--
docker run -it --rm -v /home/daniel/:/home/daniel -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY qgis-model-runner /start.sh
-->

### Ubuntu

* See directory `/ubuntu/<release name>` for the respective Dockerfile

Execute the following command to build the container and name it.

```
docker build -t qgis-model-ubuntu:<release name> ubuntu/trusty/.
```

The following commands (run in the root directory of this project) build images for both Ubuntu 14.04 and 16.04 and tag the latter as being the "latest".

```
docker build -t qgis-model-ubuntu:trusty -f ubuntu/trusty/Dockerfile ubuntu/.
docker build -t qgis-model-ubuntu:xenial -t qgis-model-ubuntu:latest -f ubuntu/xenial/Dockerfile ubuntu/.
```

(Note the use of the `-f` parameter to set the build context to the directory `/ubuntu`. This was the same `model.sh` and `util` can be used for both Dockerfiles.

## Ideas/Future work

* split up the Debian image into one "QGIS plus OTB plus SAGA", and one for the model runner
